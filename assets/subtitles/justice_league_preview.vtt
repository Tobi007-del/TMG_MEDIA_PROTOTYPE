00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:07.309
Is this what conquering is?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.109
hiding from the fight?

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.350
Oh no.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.159
Your own life.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.639
Yeah Thanks for the lift.

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:20.840
Yeah,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.510
no problem.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:22.440
You got this.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.979
These things are gonna keep coming.

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:26.389
OK.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.190
You get technical.

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:28.159
I'm on bug duty.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.870
Let's do it.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.560
Yes,

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.040
it was gross.

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.509
Oh.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.689
Oh Thank you.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.979
This is a bad.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.949
What See it.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:48.150
Whatever you're in the middle of,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.819
it's spreading for miles.

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:52.510
Satellite shows civilians moving east.

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:54.720
They're not gonna make it.

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.720
Bury it.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.639
I need you to take a walk.

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:05.040
God,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.160
I hope this is East.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.199
Right

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.550
not its mother,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.089
the power,

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.380
and power is the only law.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110
Uh

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.649
They're all too weak to see the truth.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:11.490
Well.

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.809
I believe in truth.

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.350
But I'm also a big fan of justice.

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:27.130
Oh All right.

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.339
Mm Oh yeah

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.380
Oh So how do I

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.729
help?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.820
We buy him some time.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.460
He can stop that box from destroying all life on Earth.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.240
We hope.

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.479
Well,

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.440
I knew you didn't bring me back because you liked me.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.490
I don't.

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.190
No.

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.910
Civilians very headed.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.630
There's too many of them.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.089
Yeah Come on.
